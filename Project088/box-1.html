            Aryabhata was India’s first satellite, named after a ancient Indian mathematician (5th century AD). It was
            launched by the Russians on 19 April 1975 from Kapustin Yar. The 96.3 minute orbit had an apogee of 619 km
            and a perigee of 563 km, at an inclination of 50.7 degrees. Aryabhata was built by the Indian Space Research
            Organization (ISRO) to conduct experiments in X-ray astronomy, aeronomics, and solar physics. The spacecraft
            was a 26-sided polygon 1.4 m in diameter. All faces (except the top and bottom) were covered with solar
            cells. A power failure halted experiments after 4 days in orbit. All signals from the spacecraft were lost
            after 5 days of operation. The satellite reentered the Earth’s atmosphere on 11 February 1992.
